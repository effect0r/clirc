# clirc

A C/C++ IRC bot devoted to channel control with a quote system and stream-time support for FAQs. Designed to be fairly 
modular, fast, and dynamically controllable/editable. Very much a WIP seeing as I'm still in school (last semester!).

After I graduate, work will pick up on this quickly, hopefully

## Config system:
  - Nothing yet, still fleshing it out.
